This was my second run in with Mulga’s work. I was expecting to see The Bondi Gorilla (posted earlier) on my routine sunset run, but instead I discovered, “Dolphin Beard Donnie” in its place. I was not disappointed. I love how Mulga is able to create such fluid movement with such tight, detailed line-work in Donnie’s beard as it flows into a wave.

It’s featured amongst many other illustrations, paste ups and graphics from various local artists at the Bondi Murals stretching along the boardwalk at Bondi Beach.

You can check out how he made it here.
