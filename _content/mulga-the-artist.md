Mulga the Artist (Joel Moore) is a native Sydney artist, known for his eclectic murals with fine linework, bright colors, textured shapes accompanied by magical storytelling. His work brings to life a world where gorillas run the world, bearded sailors sing cryptic tales of their life at sea, lions smoke tabacco pipes and everyone wears rainbow sunglasses.

This mural reads “When I ate a magical mung bean, it became a magical ice cream. What a delicious treat for me to eat”
