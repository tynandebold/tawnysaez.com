I almost walked right passed this eclectic mural illustrating an animalistic city scene. A beautiful bare figure of a woman with antlers and a thick heavy chain- looking pensive with her talon resting on her lips. I love the contrast of her bare figure next to the geometric shapes- itâ€™s the sharp edges against her curves, the color against the gray scale.
