In the south east corner of Melbourne’s city grid lies Rutledge Lane, a narrow laneway covered from the ground up in stencils, paste-ups and murals. I knew Melbourne was known for its unique public art expressions- but I had never experienced anything like this. The sheer volume of overlaying images, the spectrum of colors and messages behind them were overwhelmingly beautiful. “Dumpsters never seemed so intriguing,” I said to myself as my eyes darted from neon letters, to a kid robot, to a cryptic tree holding a heart.
