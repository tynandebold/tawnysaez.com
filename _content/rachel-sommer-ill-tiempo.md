Rachel Sommer is an international muralist and graphic designer, with a vast portfolio featuring custom murals, live art, signs and multi-media paintings in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Born and raised in the U.S., Rachel traveled to Australia and then to New Zealand, leaving her mark amongst other street art with pieces like this unique mural featured at Ill Tiempo Cafe on Degraves St in Melbourne, Australia. I discovered this mural while exploring Melbourne’s laneways, just a few months after it was painted in February of 2014. She used aerosol and house paint. The colors are even more vibrant in person.
