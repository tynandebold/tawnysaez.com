I discovered this piece while enjoying a nice cold Pacifico and a fish taco at Beach Burrito Company in Bondi, in the spring of 2014. Itâ€™s hidden on the wall above the stairs in the back of the restaurant and offers a unique contrast to the other walls in the restaurant that are covered in Day of the Dead murals; sugar skulls in sombreros and colorful dancing skeletons with maracas.

It is one of my favorite pieces.
