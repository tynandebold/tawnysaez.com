What has become one of the most iconic pieces of street art in Williamsburg, New York, started as one of 255,000 art submissions to The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards in 2014. Steven Paul, a High School Senior from Brooklyn, was honored at Carnegie Hall as Gold Medalist for his photograph, “Lost Time.” <a href="http://colossalmedia.com/portfolio-posts/scholastic-2/" target="_blank">Colossal Media</a>, partnered with Scholastic to celebrate Steven’s artwork by hand painting his winning photograph onto a 4 story high mural overlooking Broadway Avenue in Williamsburg.

<a href="http://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/2331/alliance-for-young-artists-writers" target="_blank">The Alliance for Young Artists and Writers</a> is a nonprofit organization that identifies teenagers with exceptional artistic and literary talent and brings their remarkable work to a national audience through The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. The Awards, dating back to 1923 have a very impressive list of past winners including Andy Warhol, Sylvia Plath, Truman Capote, Richard Avedon, Robert Redford and Joyce Carol Oates. **It is a very significant opportunity to empower young creative minds.** Each year, the Alliance partners with more than 100 regional affiliates across the country to bring the program to local communities. Teens in grades 7 through 12 can apply in 30 categories of art and writing for the chance to earn scholarships and have their works exhibited or published.

Colossal Media donated the 4 story high wall and their own artists’ time to bring Steven’s photograph to life – and making it to what some call the “Mona Lisa of Williamsburg.”
