The purpose of this website is to share stories behind street art. While traveling in Australia, I found a new attraction and affinity for outdoor art in public spaces, from hand painted murals and sidewalk sketches to stenciled portraits and bold typography. Although the anonymity behind these pieces was what made them so unique, my curiosity wouldn’t stop after one simple gaze. On the plane back to the U.S, after 9 long months away from home, I realized the wealth of street art photography I had collected. When I moved to D.C and recently to Brooklyn, the archive grew, and so did the artist’s stories.

I discover the most street art while running. After I come across a new piece, I spend my morning commute researching the artist’s tag. I feel like a kid at an Easter egg hunt, and when I find the artist’s website or blog, it opens up an entirely new perspective. Yet, what I love most about public, urban art is that unlike museums and galleries, you experience the pieces unintentionally in the most unpredictable places, in the most unpredictable moods, while the internal reactions are unknown and unlimited.

My intention here is to provide context to the colors, faces and words from the artists' perspective that you might have been wondering about, while still allowing you to experience that first sight reaction, that surprise of finding a new installation of street art.
