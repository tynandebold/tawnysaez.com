      <p>I believe visual communication has the power to raise awareness of social issues by inspiring people to think differently and to challenge the status quo. Artists around the globe recognize this and are using the streets as their canvas to amplify messaging in support of positive social change. Through large scale murals and small paste ups in heavily trafficked urban areas, street artists are able to bring attention to pressing issues such as education, women’s rights, racial justice, violence and more.</p>

<p>By creating this website, my intention is to build a platform to share and connect with street artists and their stories that succeed in shaping people’s mindsets. As an outcome, I hope local conversations will be ignited involving solution based ideas – and the artists’ messages may also reach isolated individuals, providing a sense of commonality, unity and most importantly, a stronger voice.</p>
