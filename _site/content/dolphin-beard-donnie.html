      <p>This was my second run in with Mulga’s work. I was expecting to see The Bondi Gorilla (posted earlier) on my routine sunset run, but instead I discovered, “Dolphin Beard Donnie” in its place. I was not disappointed. I love how Mulga is able to create such fluid movement with such tight, detailed line-work in Donnie’s beard as it flows into a wave.</p>

<p>It’s featured amongst many other illustrations, paste ups and graphics from various local artists at the Bondi Murals stretching along the boardwalk at Bondi Beach.</p>

<p>You can check out how he made it here.</p>
