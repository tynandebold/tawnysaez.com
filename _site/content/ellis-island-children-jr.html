      <p>French street artist JR is known for creating culturally provocative exhibitions around the globe that demystify preconceived notions perpetuating deep rooted social issues, from immigration to women’s rights.</p>

<p>This large mural in Tribeca is titled, “Ellis Island Children” and is part of a larger photo installation inside an abandoned hospital on Ellis Island called “Unframed.” Covering the floors and walls of the hospital are pictures taken over a century ago of immigrant and hospital patients. “Unframed” pays homage to all immigrants who make up our families, our friends, our co-workers and our nation today.</p>

<p>In light of the larger immigrant and refugee crisis we face today, JR’s exhibition reminds us that we are all immigrants – if not first generation, we are the sons and daughters of immigrants in this country, one way or another.</p>

<p>JR’s work is about challenging the status quo.</p>
